# Nothing to see here… *yet*

If you're seeing this text, it's because the winning bot report has not yet been selected. 

This placeholder file will be replaced with the [automated findings report](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens/submission-policy#automated-findings-considered-known-issues) as soon as the bot race for this audit has been judged -- typically it's posted 24 hours or less after the audit starts.
